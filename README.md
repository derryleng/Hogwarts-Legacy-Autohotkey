# Hogwarts Legacy AutoHotkey Script
Binds all hotbar spells to separate keys, optimised for gaming mouse.

My default binds (spell is purely personal preference):

| Hotbar | Spell Slot | Key | Spell |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | Accio |
| 1 | 2 | 2 | Incendio |
| 1 | 3 | 3 | Levioso |
| 1 | 4 | 4 | Descendo |
| 2 | 1 | 5 | Diffindo |
| 2 | 2 | 6 | Glacius |
| 2 | 3 | 7 | Depulso |
| 2 | 4 | 8 | Expelliarmus |
| 3 | 1 | 9 | Arresto Momentum |
| 3 | 2 | 0 | Confringo |
| 3 | 3 | - | Bombarda |
| 3 | 4 | = | Transformation |
| 4 | 1 | \ | Avada Kedavra |
| 4 | 2 | e* | Lumos |
| 4 | 3 | y | Crucio |
| 4 | 4 | h | Imperio |

\* Note this keybind will mess with scrolling in horizontal menus (e.g. room of requirement), you may want to change.
